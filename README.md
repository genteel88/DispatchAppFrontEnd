We are a logistics company with ground robot assistants and drones to help users in San Francisco deliver small and medium-sized items. We have a total of 3 distribution stations in the city.

The friendly GUI allows user to register, login, track order of delivery items, and to choose a delivery carrier option - Drone vs Robot.

Main application stacks used are ReactJS, Material UI, Ant Design, Google Map JavaScript API and React Wrapper.
